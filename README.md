# CodSoft-DS-Internship

Welcome to my repository for the CodSoft Data Science Internship. This repository contains three exciting projects focusing on machine learning and data analysis.

## Projects Overview

1. **Task 1: Iris Flower Classification**
   - This project involves building a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their measurements.
   - The Iris dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which can be distinguished by their sepal and petal dimensions.
   - **Objective:** Train a machine learning model to accurately classify Iris flowers into their respective species.
   - **Dataset Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)

2. **Task 2: Sales Prediction**
   - Predicting future sales using machine learning techniques, considering factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection.
   - **Objective:** Develop a model to forecast product sales based on various marketing and business parameters.
   - **Dataset Source:** [Sample Sales Dataset](link_to_your_sales_data_source)

3. **Task 3: Movie Rating Prediction**
   - Building a model to predict movie ratings based on features like genre, director, and actors.
   - **Objective:** Analyze historical movie data and create a model that estimates movie ratings accurately.
   - **Dataset Source:** [Sample Movie Rating Dataset](link_to_your_movie_data_source)

## Project Structure

- Each project has its own directory containing:
  - `README.md`: Detailed explanation of the project, including goals, techniques used, and dataset information.
  - `project_name.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the project code and analysis.
  - `data/`: Folder to store project-specific datasets.

## Conclusion
My journey with CodSofft has been nothing short of phenomenal!. Each task has fueled my passion for innovation and problem-solving. I'm eager to continue pushing boundaries, learning, and contributing to groundbreaking projects.

Your feedback and contributions to these projects are highly appreciated as I continue to grow and refine my skills in the field of data science.
